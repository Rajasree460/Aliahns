# Here is the explanation & screenshorts of working<br>

I have made an employee card ,that contains some basic details. There is a QR at the below of the card. Scan the QR & if you are scanning it at 10 AM or between 12 Am-10 Am,you can see the message 'Welcome to work!" within an alert box. By any chance if you are late by 1 or more minutes then you can see the message "Sorry, you are late!" .The QR code functionality leverages the moment-timezone library to accurately determine the time in the specified timezone (Asia/Kolkata).Upon scanning the QR code, the system checks the current time and displays the appropriate alert message based on the conditions mentioned above.
